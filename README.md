⚠️ **THIS IS STILL VERY WORK IN PROGRESS AND EVEN CORE FUNCTIONALITY DOESN'T EXIST YET!!!**⚠️

---

LibreVox aims to provide decentralized and fully anonymous forms.

These features are planned:

- [x] Anonyminity
- [ ] Multi page support
- [ ] Variables
- [ ] Powerfull but yet simple conditional branching
- [ ] Anonymous insights and visualizations

## Technologies

In the future I will try to make this a monorepo combining the frontend and backend.  
But currently I'm only working on the backend, a web ui is planned and will be implemented later this year.

### Backend (API)

- [Bun](https://bun.sh/)
- [Elysia](https://elysiajs.com/)
- [EdgeDB](https://www.edgedb.com/)
