# Librepoll

Librepoll is an anonymous polling service with strong emphasis on full anonymity and decentralization.
Librepoll aims to provide users with a secure and private platform for creating and participating in polls without compromisng their identity.

I've already planned how to archieve my main goals and will update the README once I've started to actually implement those.

I also want to change the name, if you have an idea and don't have problems with it beeing a new name feel free to make a suggestion in an issue.
